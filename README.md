# BitcoInstant

A cryptocurrency price ticker built with Bitcoinaverage API.

Users can check the prices of different cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoins ) in different currencies (USD, CAD, GBP and EUR) - all in real-time.

I worked on this mini project while having a Big Mac, in order to further practice what I have learned in the web development bootcamp. This project only took less than one day to build.
